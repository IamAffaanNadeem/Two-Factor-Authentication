Here’s a sample `README.md` for your Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system project:

---

# Two-Factor Authentication System

This is a simple Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system built using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend. The system sends a verification code to the user's email address and allows them to authenticate by entering the code on a second page.

## Features
- Email-based 2FA: A verification code is sent to the user's email.
- Flask Backend: Handles logic for generating and validating the code.
- Simple Web Interface: Built using HTML and CSS.
- Success and Error Messages: Flash messages notify the user of their action's result.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Email**: Flask-Mail (for sending email verification codes)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Internet connection (for sending emails)
- A Gmail account or any email service for sending the verification codes.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/two-factor-auth.git
cd two-factor-auth
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
- Flask
- Flask-Mail

You can create a `requirements.txt` file by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Email
Open the `app.py` file and replace the following lines with your email details:

```python
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your_email@gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_password'
```

If you're using Gmail, it's recommended to create an **App Password** (if you have 2FA enabled on your Gmail account) instead of using your regular Gmail password.

### 4. Run the Application
Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Access the Web Application
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the 2FA system.

### 6. Test the System
- Enter your email on the landing page.
- A verification code will be sent to your email.
- Enter the code on the verification page to complete the authentication process.

## File Structure

```
two_factor_auth/
│
├── app.py                  # Main Python file with Flask backend
│
├── templates/              # Folder for HTML files
│   ├── index.html          # Landing page for email input
│   └── verify_code.html    # Page for code verification
│
├── static/                 # Folder for static files (CSS, JS)
│   └── styles.css          # CSS file for styling
│
└── .env                    # Optional: for storing sensitive information like email credentials (e.g., using dotenv)
```

## How It Works
1. **Step 1**: The user enters their email address on the landing page.
2. **Step 2**: A 6-digit verification code is generated and sent to the provided email address.
3. **Step 3**: The user enters the code on a verification page to complete the authentication process.
4. **Step 4**: If the code matches, the user is authenticated and a success message is displayed.

## Security Considerations
- This system uses a basic email-based 2FA mechanism, which is commonly used in many applications. However, it does not include additional security measures like rate limiting or email verification to prevent abuse. You should consider enhancing it with such features for production-level applications.
